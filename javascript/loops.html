   //x=0 is a first or counter variable. its keep track of how many times the code has been executed., x<5 is a second or condition code .its keep looping until the condition is met., x++ is a last.counter variable increment usually 1.

   //while loop
   let y=1
   while(y<=5)
   //y is variable. it is the value that will change., =5 is ending condition.maximum value a variable can reach.
